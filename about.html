        <h2>Run Transfer Plugin</h2>
This plugin transfers signal processing output files to another Torrent Server and launches a re-analysis
of the dataset on that server.  The files that are transferred are Basecaller Input Files.
<ul>
    <li>1.wells
    <li>analysis.bfmask.bin
    <li>analysis.bfmask.stat
    <li>average_nuke_trace*.txt
    <li>Bead_density_*.png
</ul>
Proton datasets will transfer block-level files when the thumbnail option is unchecked.  When thumbnail option is checked,
only the thumbnail files will be transferred.
